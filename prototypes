Prototypes (low fidelity and high fidelity) to be exported and added to "prototypes/low fidelity/" and "prototypes/high fidelity/" sub-folders. ALL the screens MUST be added to these folders. Additionally, create a text file in each folder with links to currently existing prototypes in Axure or Figma.
